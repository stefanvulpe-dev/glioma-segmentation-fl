Introduced FedProx on the client by adding a proximal penalty to the training loss:
loss = base_loss + 0.5 * mu * ||w - w_global||^2 (when mu > 0).

To compute that penalty, the client now stores a snapshot of the received global weights at the start of fit() (global_params).

On the server side, now send the FedProx hyperparameter mu to clients via on_fit_config_fn (set it to 0.01).
If mu = 0, the code behaves like FedAvg.
